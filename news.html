       <p>Well long story short it’s a genre of electronic dance music which was a subgenre of hardcore. It was born in England in the early 90s. People that were marching towards colorful light future chose the happy hardcore path and people who lived in reality, the working class, they chose jungle, it was raw it was dark it was heavy it was most importantly real. Music itself is fast, contains breakbeat, dub style bassline, percussive loops, soundclash, riddim samples, synths, effects etc. Long story short it is a well known genre in the UK. This was an answer to USA hip hop scene at the time. I think it’s a gift to be a part of such maybe unique scene which in some countries is becoming a niche culture but in some it never even existed.. </p>
         <p>I was at a transition phase from heavy music scene to bits of electronic. Drum and bass was pretty popular at the time. After going to my first party (still remember like it was yesterday) and experiencing everything myself, straight away I knew this is where I see myself shining. I said to my friend at the time that somehow I don’t know how but we have to be a part of this. And this is how couple months later I’ve started DJ’ing in in 2012 and later on started making my own parties in 2014 with a group of people that I’ve gathered and called “Revolution Crew”. I think it was in 2014 that I’ve managed to get into an abandoned paper factory here in Aarhus Viby and made my first pirate party there. After that night the crew was born, and we’ve been active until around 2017 and at 2018 nothing was left. But I’m looking forward to the new crew to rise like a phoenix from revolution crew’s ashes and keep it coming.</p>
