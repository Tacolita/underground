        <h2 class="article-title">Jungle?</h2>
        <p>Well long story short it’s a genre of electronic dance music which was a subgenre of hardcore. It was born in England in the early 90s. People that were marching towards colorful light future chose the happy hardcore path and people who lived in reality, the working class, they chose jungle, it was raw it was dark it was heavy it was most importantly real. Music itself is fast, contains breakbeat, dub style bassline, percussive loops, soundclash, riddim samples, synths, effects etc. Long story short it is a well known genre in the UK. This was an answer to USA hip hop scene at the time. I think it’s a gift to be a part of such maybe unique scene which in some countries is becoming a niche culture but in some it never even existed.. </p>
         <h2 class="article-title">How everything started?</h2>
        <p>I was at a transition phase from heavy music scene to bits of electronic. Drum and bass was pretty popular at the time. After going to my first party (still remember like it was yesterday) and experiencing everything myself, straight away I knew this is where I see myself shining. I said to my friend at the time that somehow I don’t know how but we have to be a part of this. And this is how couple months later I’ve started DJ’ing in in 2012 and later on started making my own parties in 2014 with a group of people that I’ve gathered and called “Revolution Crew”. I think it was in 2014 that I’ve managed to get into an abandoned paper factory here in Aarhus Viby and made my first pirate party there. After that night the crew was born, and we’ve been active until around 2017 and at 2018 nothing was left. But I’m looking forward to the new crew to rise like a phoenix from revolution crew’s ashes and keep it coming.</p>
        <h2 class="article-title">Idea behind the party ? </h2>
        <p>Well the idea is to set free the selector. In other words, to push their dark side out, a lot of DJs can find themselves locked in a box because they maybe can’t play something that’s too harsh or too dark for people out there. Well we are the ones, the ones that not only give freedom of playing those tracks, but we actually ask our DJs all the time to show their dark side, not as much to show it as just let it bloom. </p>
         <h2 class="article-title">What "message" do you want to spread to your listeners? </h2>
        <p>Might sound like a cliché but I see myself in every single one of the people, takes me back to my first entry to the scene every time. It was a crucial breaking point in my life and with it I found an escape from my “problems”. This other realm, even the feeling when you enter cold concrete surroundings and feel the low frequencies vibrating far away you already get excited. Everything was just so tough, raw, maybe even cold and dark and just generally cool about it. And as soon as I became a part of it I found plenty reasons for coming back again and again. Probably that is the motivation for it, to give people what I once was given and hopefully not only help but wake up something special in someone or just let them runaway, at least for a night. This is not your everyday part of society, but you are very welcome to escape together – is the message. </p>
        <h2 class="article-title">What’s in the future of the parties? </h2>
        <p>Honestly we are just keeping our hopes up towards growth and maintaining quality of the parties. Everyone is busy with their lives so we just can’t be as active anymore per say, but we are productive behind the scene planning and communicating as it comes to the parties, quality over quantity. </p>
